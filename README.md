## Overview

**Mario Platformer Game** is a 2D platformer game built entirely in Python, featuring classic platform mechanics inspired by retro games like _Super Mario_. Players can control a character to navigate platforms, avoid obstacles, and collect items. The game uses basic game mechanics such as jumping, moving left or right, and interacting with the environment. This game was inspired by the video of my mentor **Tim Ruscica - Tech With Tim**.
